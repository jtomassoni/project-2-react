# Welcome to jtX

What I have built for you is an app that quickly and easily displays spaceX launch data.

### It includes:

- The most recent Launch on load.
- The ability to view all Launches in SpaceX history, as well as any upcoming launches that are officially scheduled.
- Vehichles
- Launchpads
- Crew
- Starman Bonus

Youre able to navigate between launch data as well as vehicles, launchpads, and landpads.

## User Stories

### MVP Goals

As a user, I want to be able to see the latest SpaceX flight info.
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the SpaceX flights in a list.
As a user, I want to be able to click one of the spaceX flights in that list, and be brought to a details screen.

### Stretch Goals

Any kind of filtering: mission type(Starlink, National Recon Office, NASA), vehicles used(rockets, recovery drone ships), date ranges.
Or custom Sorting, oldest first, newest first.(two buttons)
